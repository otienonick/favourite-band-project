    <h2 class="vibrations">HISTORY</h2>

    <p><strong>Bulgin , Craig , and Spence  </strong>first met as children at the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic, all sufferers of polio in the epidemic that spread through Jamaica in the 1950s. 
    Several years later that they formed Israel Vibration.

    They formed a vocal group, initially adopting the name Israel Vibration Israel Vibrates, soon becoming simply Israel Vibration. 
    They survived on money earned singing in the streets for several years, and in 1975 attempted to launch a recording career at Channel One Studios, but the track they recorded there ("Bad Intention") was not released.
    Funding for their first album came in the form of a grant from the Twelve Tribes of Israel branch of Rastafarai after Hugh Booth, a member of the Twelve Tribes, had overheard the three men singing in a wooded area outside Kingston. Apple and Wiss were living in the area, which they had converted into a home. 
  <p> Recorded at the Treasure Isle studio in 1976, their debut release was the single "Why Worry", released on the Twelve Tribes label late that year.
     The single was successful enough for the group to be offered support slots at shows by artists such as Dennis Brown, Inner Circle, and Bob Marley.
    They then began working with producer Tommy Cowan, releasing "The Same Song" (on which they were backed by members of Inner Circle) on his Top Ranking label in 1977, and an album of the same name followed in 1978.</p>
   <p> The album, and its dub counterpart, Israel Tafari (aka Same Song Dub) were a success internationally, leading to a deal with EMI label Harvest to reissue the album in the UK, the label also releasing a second album, Unconquered People in 1980.
    The group relocated to New York in 1982 to seek professional health care, and escape the growing dancehall movement in Jamaica, but struggled to break through there and they split up but by 1987 they decided to relaunch Israel Vibration and release their fourth album strength of my life.In 1997, Apple Gabriel left the group to pursue a solo career,Skelly and Wiss continue to record albums and tour the world as Israel Vibration.
    On March 23rd, 2020, Albert "Apple Gabriel" co-founder and former member of the group died due to stroke.<a id="Read" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Vibration">Read more</a></a></p>
